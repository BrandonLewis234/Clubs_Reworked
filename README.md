# Clubs Reworked

**Introduces clubs as a new weapon type usable by the player.**

Previously, clubs were only usable by mobs, and spawning them in creative mode had limited usage — no blocking and no signature move.

This mod aims to change that.

***

## Overview

Clubs are a new **one-handed melee weapon** with:

*   A unique attack pattern
*   Charged attack
*   Signature move

They will be craftable in the standard crafting benches.

***

## Current Status (Version 1.0.0)

*   Only the **Crude Club** is complete.

In time, the goal is to fully implement every club that exists in the game but is currently unusable by players.

***

## Clubs Implemented

*   Crude Club

***

## Clubs Planned for Implementation

*   Rusty Iron Club
*   Iron Club
*   Copper Club
*   Thorium Club
*   Cobalt Club
*   Adamantine Club
*   Mithril Club
*   Onyxium Club
*   Scrap Club
*   Tribal Club
*   Stone Trork Club
*   Doomed Outlander Club

## Further Plans

Once the other clubs are implemented, the mod will also aim to implement the **flail** and **zombie arm** weapon types, which are in a similar situation to the club.
