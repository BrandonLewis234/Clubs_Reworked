# <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/clubs-reworked" target="_blank">Clubs Reworked</a>

## Introduces clubs as a new weapon type usable by the player.

Previously, clubs were only usable by mobs, and spawning them in creative mode had limited usage — no blocking and no signature move.

This mod aims to change that.

## Overview

Clubs are a new one-handed melee weapon with:

* A unique attack pattern
* Charged attack
* Signature move

## Current Status (Version 1.4.0)

The following clubs are implemented:

* Crude Club
* Copper Club
* Iron Club
* Thorium Club
* Cobalt Club
* Adamantite Club
* Mithril Club

The Crude club is craftable without a workbench.

The other clubs are craftable in the blacksmith's bench─found under the "maces" category─with tier requirements following with their rarity.

## Clubs Planned for Implementation

* Rusty Iron Club
* Onyxium Club
* Scrap Club
* Tribal Club
* Stone Trork Club
* Doomed Outlander Club

## Plans

* Implement the clubs that are unique to mobs, and add them to their drop tables.

### Further Goals

* Once the other clubs are implemented, the mod will also aim to implement the flail and zombie arm weapon types, which are in a similar situation to the club.
